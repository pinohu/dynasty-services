5. Have you tried solving this before? What happened?

### Objection Handling
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | "What's the cost of NOT automating? $0/mo replaces $X,000 in manual labor." |
| "We can build it ourselves" | "You could — in 6-12 months. I deliver in 3-5 days because I've already built it." |
| "We need to think about it" | "Of course. The proposal is valid for 14 days. After that, pricing may change." |
| "Can you do it cheaper?" | "This is fixed-price based on proven delivery. Bundle 3+ packages for 15% off setup." |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | "Every system is proven in production. PA CROP runs 24/7 on this exact infrastructure." |
